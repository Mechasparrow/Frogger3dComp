# Frogger3dComp
A game with a frog for a competition
Randomly generated terrain on 4 sides surrounding main character.
This terrain is generated to varrying lengths depending on the level difficulty
6 different biomes are used: Lava, Grass, Water, Earth, Sand, and Wood.

Make it to the end without getting hit and win!

Don't forget that you can change which terrain you are on by jumping all the way to either side of the current terrain,
  which will cause the cube world to shift so that what used to be the wall on that side is now the floor.
  
Enjoy :)
